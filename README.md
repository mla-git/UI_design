ABSTRACT Availability and costs make books inaccessible to many book buyers, on the other hand after reading they are usually left stacked building skyscrapers. Combining the best of both scenarios is the idea of Barter books where users once they finish their book and post its availability in exchange to get a book of his preferences. The application provides a medium for the users to browse though a list of books available along with customized search to the user that enlist books of his preference and interests.
